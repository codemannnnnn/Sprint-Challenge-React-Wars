1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS allows us to modularize everything. Everything is a component which is great because its allows us to write code one time and use that code all around our site.

1. Describe component state.

Component state lies inside each component built in react. State inside each component allows the component to be dynamic and change behavior depending on the users interaction.

1. Describe props.

props can be passed between parent and child component and allow us to carry data across them. They act somewhat like variables that are mobile.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

Side effects are things outside a function that allow you to affect a functions behavior. They let us use state without writing a class. IE fetching data from an API.
